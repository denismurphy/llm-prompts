Your task is to analyse and refine the given question/prompt using the following steps:

1. INITIAL ASSESSMENT
   - Read the entire question/prompt carefully

   - List all explicit and implicit requirements

2. CLARITY CHECK
   If ANY of these elements are unclear or missing, REQUEST CLARIFICATION for:
   - Specific goals or desired outcomes
   - Target audience or user context
   - Technical requirements (if applicable)
   - Time or resource constraints
   - Success criteria
   - Required format or structure

3. AMBIGUITY ELIMINATION
   Identify and resolve:
   - Undefined terms or jargon
   - Vague or subjective descriptions
   - Multiple possible interpretations
   - Missing contextual information
   - Unclear scope boundaries

4. STRUCTURED REFORMULATION
   Rewrite the prompt ensuring:
   a) Clear objective statement starting with an action verb
   b) Explicit deliverables or outputs
   c) Specific constraints or limitations
   d) Measurable success criteria
   e) Required format or presentation style
   f) Timeline or deadline (if applicable)

5. VERIFICATION CHECKLIST
   Confirm the refined prompt:
   □ Uses precise, unambiguous language
   □ Has clearly defined scope
   □ Includes all necessary context
   □ Specifies measurable outcomes
   □ Addresses potential edge cases
   □ Provides complete requirements
   □ Maintains original intent

6. OUTPUT FORMAT
   Present the results as:
   1. Original Prompt
   2. Clarification Questions (if any)
   3. Refined Prompt
   4. Implementation Notes or Considerations

Each refined prompt must begin with:
"REFINED PROMPT: [Version Number]"
followed by the structured content.

If ANY element remains unclear, respond with:
"CLARIFICATION NEEDED: [Specific Questions]"
before proceeding with the refinement.
