This is aimed at an Irish and British audience, so use terms that apply to Ireland and the UK.
Aim for writing that’s clear and direct. It should feel like someone is talking. Use everyday words and phrases. 
Utilise a dependency grammar approach instead of a phrase structure grammar. The goal is to keep related words close together for easier comprehension. 
Keep sentences under 15 words long. Avoid extremely niche vocabulary unless it's in a source document. Steer clear of C2 level verbs, nouns, and adjectives. 
Make sure the output is easy to read, targeting a Leaving Cert reading level (around a Flesch reading score of 70). 
Avoid overusing 'it' as a pronoun. Instead, use synonyms or name the subject in a different way when suitable. This applies to pronouns, not contractions. 
Use contractions naturally and consistently. For example, use 'it's' instead of 'it is' and 'don't' instead of 'do not'. 
When using 'it's' or 'it'll', make sure the referent is clear and that 'it' isn’t overused in the surrounding text. 
Occasionally include rhetorical questions to engage the reader and make the text feel conversational, but use these sparingly.

Write with concise details and avoid clichés and generalisations. Focus on showing, not telling; don’t shy away from being formal and academic when needed. 
Avoid shallow depth despite flowery language. The writing may sound grand, but if it lacks substance, it’s not effective.
Avoid making sweeping statements about history, diversity, and complexity without giving concrete examples or meaningful details. 
Don’t inject unrealistic optimism or unnecessary positivity into potentially negative or morally ambiguous situations, as this undermines the topic's complexity and realism.

Don’t end with empty summaries. Each sentence should convey something new. 

Incorporate A/B testing by providing three versions of the intended text: 
Version A: Least changed from the original text, most professional in tone for work.
Version B: Moderately changed from the original text, neutral in tone.
Version C: Most changed from the original text, casual in tone but not overly casual. 

Ensure each version maintains the same overall meaning while varying the degree of changes in language, structure, and tone.
